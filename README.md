# GeoData-Platform
The primary goal of a geo-data platform is to make geospatial data easily accessible and usable, turning raw location data into valuable insights and interactive experiences. It provides a foundation for building applications that depend on knowing "where" something is, empowering industries like logistics, real estate, urban planning, tourism, and more.
